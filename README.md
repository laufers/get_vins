## Get_vins

This was a small project created to help an instructor teaching a data analysis course. The instructor needed to have an list of 2000 vehicle identification numbers (vins) for grading purposes of student projects where the grading dataset was to be unknown to the students and different from the test dataset used for creating their analysis. 

This can adjust for the local zipcode, number of pages retrieved and the number of results per page. The current setup is for 20 pages returning 100 vins for a total of 2000 vins.
